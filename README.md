liri-node-app

This application utilizes Node.js to take two user inputs from the command line.
The user command tells the program to search either: Spotify, OMDB, or Bandsintown. 
The search will locate information from a song, a movie or a band/artist. 
It will then output the song information, movie information or concert information for that band or artist.

This application uses modules such as Axios, spotify, and moment among others.
